  "body": "The song back up is an Afro trap inspiration that expresses God as the only hope that can never fail despite the failures in the world economies, political systems,national and international bodies and governments, shortages and limitations due to human frailty. \n\nWhen you are in a strange land and everything fails you and you know no one what do you do?  Put all your trust in the Lord and not in your bank account,skills,technical know how, beauty,or handsomeness. \n\n Psalm 5 \\[11]But let all those who take refuge and put their trust in You rejoice; let them ever sing and shout for joy, because You make a covering over them and defend them; let those also who love Your name be joyful in You and be in high spirits. \n\nIts from this understanding that prompted the inspiration behind \"Backup\" . Back then in boarding schools,only those who had back up food in their trunks survived \"famine periods\".\n\n As we listen and promote the song no matter what is happening in the world, you are becoming Goshen that increased despite Economic recession.\n\nPlease visit our music library to download and stream the audio however and whenever you like.",
