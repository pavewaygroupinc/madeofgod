  "body": "Gotcha!!!! \n\nApparently, most of you do not know the meaning of \"Worship Exodus\". \n\nexodus defined by google is:  /ˈɛksədəs/ : a mass departure of people. \n\nHowever, according to the CEO of \" worship Exodus event\" [Mr Cyril Bisong](https://madeofgodtv.com/profile/meet-bisong-cyril), it refers to the movement of people from one spiritual realm to the other. It is an elevation phase from glory to glory, from revelations to higher dimensions of visions. \n\nThe event was/is a highly spiritual one. The reason why it's main goal, is to gather worshippers from all over the globe under one roof to worship the Most High. \n\nThe event which took place this year on the 25th of September 2020, gathered saints from all over Cameroon. The hall was full to the maximum with people who came to raise their worship to God. \n\nThe ministers who led the worship? they were magnificent. A little lapses here and there, but they succeeded to put the hall on the pedestal of continuous worship and sustained a spiritually soaked atmosphere. \n\nWhile they worshipped, tears were not the only things that rolled down, knees and whole bodies too. The whole event was profound. \n\nI would love to talk about the halls aesthetics and the whole organisation, but I will let the pictures do the talking. \n\nvisit their website for more info and to catch up on updates about next year's program. \n\nwww.worshipexodus.com  \n\n![worship exodus](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyt6izhug/image/upload/v1601760518/120390784_1074399356336180_7390899222233671802_n_guaxpt.jpg \"Pastors praying for the event host\")\n\n![worship exodus](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyt6izhug/image/upload/v1602782768/120343459_691345084807300_7551457007019097654_o_hxh3ov.jpg \"rochie Osvalin and Wache G\")\n\n![worship exodus](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyt6izhug/image/upload/v1602782766/120252057_691345221473953_2613968420639073744_o_z1rps5.jpg \"Peggy Anderson\")\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
