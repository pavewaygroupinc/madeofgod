An accurate understanding  of  predestination  puts  us  on  an illuminated  path  to  making  the  most  of  our lives  on  earth. \n\n Predestination  is  a  beautiful thing  because  it  automatically  means  no  man‟s life  is  a  waste  unless  they  don‟t  do  what  they were  created  to.\n\n  What  a  life  on  earth  you  will enjoy  when  you  are  certain  you  are  doing  just what  you  were  created  to  do.  \n\nThis  is  the  reason I  write,  teach,  train,  coach,  inspire,  heal  etc.  I found  my  purpose  and  I  gave  my  all  to  it.  Now my  life  is  beautiful.  Let  us  look  at  the  beauty that  predestination  offers  a  purpose  driven individual. \n\n1. The  End  is  Glory.\n\n Glory  is  not  a  religious  term.  It  defines  the full  bloom  of  a  thing.  The  glory  of  an  apple seed  is  the  apple  tree.\n\n  When  the  tree  is  full  of apple  fruits  and  blossoming,  that  is  its  glory. \n\nThis  glory  is  hidden  in  a  dry  ugly  seed  but when  planted  and  cultivated,  you  find  a  tree  in it that  produces  so  many  apples  with uncountable  seeds  in  the  apple  fruit.  \n\nYour purpose  when  pursued,  leads  to  glory.  Those who  are  predestinated  are  predestinated  for glory.   \n\n“And  those  he  predestined, he also called; those  he called, he also justified; those  he justified,  he also glorified” Romans  8:30 The  glory  of  God  is  simply  the manifestation  of  this  purpose  in  full  bloom which  any  man  can  reveal  to  his  world. \n\n God  is experienced  in  this  world  through  purpose. Men  glorify  God  when  they  see  other  men reveal  Him  through  the  accomplishment  of their  purpose  (the  work  that  was  fore-ordained for  them). \n\n This  now  gives  meaning  to  two inspired  biblical  passages.  What  did  Paul  say? “For  we  are  God‟s  workmanship,  created  in Christ  Jesus  to  do  good  works,  which  God prepared  in  advance  for  us  to  do”  (Eph  2:10 NIV). \n\n Do  you  see  that  the  good  works  is  not talking  about  “philanthropic  gestures”  or  mere moral  actions,  but  some  prepared  or  planned work  (purpose)  for  us  to  carry  out?  \n\nAnd  then Jesus  now  tells  us  something  amazing:  “Let your  light  so  shine  before  men,  that  they  may see  your  good  works,  and  glorify  your  Father which  is  in  heaven”  (Matt  5:16).  \n\nYour  light  is your  purpose  (foreordained  works)  which causes  men  to  glorify  God  in  you.\n\n  If  you  seek  a glorious  end,  then  seek  purpose!  Your  glory  is tied  to  your purpose. \\[4:56 PM, 5/14/2020] A L. D: 2.  There  is  a  Good  Plan  in  place  for  your Discovery  and  Pursuit.\n\n God  is  Love.  When  you  know  that  God  is  a good  God,  you  will  be  rest  assured  that  if  He has  any  plans,  they  must  be  good  plans. \n\nSometimes  from  our  limited  perspective (under  the  sun),  we  question  His  goodness, faithfulness,  love  etc. \n\n That  is  because  you  can‟t see  the  full  picture  if  you  keep  looking  at  things only  from  an  earthly  perspective.  If  all  you process  comes  only  from  the  media,  your surroundings,  and  negative  vibes  from  people around  you,  then  you  may  question  a  very good  plan.\n\n  That  is  why  discovery  of  purpose sets  a  man  on  a  course.  Your  life  begins  to make  sense  even  in  chaos  and  you  can  see  the whole  earth  filled  with  His  glory  irrespective  of all  the  negative  happenings.  This  is  what  your Creator  says:  “I know  what  I‟m doing. \n\n I  have it all planned  out  –  plans  to  take care of you, not abandon you, plans  to  give you the future you hope  for” Jeremiah  29:11  (The  Msg). \n\nDid  you  see  that?  Why  will  God  be  assuring you  that  you  should  trust  His  plans?  This  is definitely  because  at  times  it  may  not  look  like a  good  one  in  your  eyes.  \n\nCould  you  have thought  going  to  prison  was  a  good  plan  for Joseph?  Yet  see  how  it  turned  out.  He  fulfilled his  purpose  through  prison,  betrayal,  false accusations  etc. \n\n You  too  can  get  there  if  you trust  his  preordained  plan.  Discover  it  and pursue  it no matter  what! \n\n3. When  you  Accomplish  your  Purpose you can Know  it. \n\nWe  can  define  predestination  as  a  pre-planned  journey  with  a  glorious  end.  It  is  the greatest adventure  on  earth.  It  is  a “destination”.  \n\nIt  is  unique  and  every  man  must run  his  course  on  his  lane  while  inspiring others  with  their  pursuit.  If  there  is  an  end, then you can get there and know it,  if you had  a clear  picture  of  the  destination  and  a  mastery of  what  your  purpose  was.  Isn‟t  it  a  beautiful thing?  \n\nTo  get  there  and  know  it!  I  know  you may  be  wondering  if  this  is  really  possible.  \n\nYes it  is!  You  can  serve  God‟s  purpose  on  earth before  ever  leaving  and  if  you  engage  it  right now  as  you  are  reading  this,  you  have  just begun  the  most  exciting  journey  in  your  life and  you  have  begun  living  for  real.  \n\nIt  is  written, “For  when  David  had  served  God‟s  purpose  in his  own  generation,  he  fell  asleep…”  (Acts 13:36  NIV).  \n\nMen  who  complete  their  divine assignment don‟t  die.  They sleep! What  do  you  think  Jesus  meant  when  He said  “it  is  finished!”  on  the  Cross?  \n\nHe  was referring  to  what  He  came  to  do  on  earth.  He knew  this  was  how  it  was  supposed  to  end  and He knew  He  had  come to the end  and  the  only thing  left  was  glory. \n\n Remember,  glory  is  the end.  Well,  apart  from  Jesus,  who  else  can finish  their  assignment  on  earth?\n\n  We  can believe  that  maybe  Jesus  did,  after  all  He  was God  in  the  flesh;  but  can  other  men  do?  Let me  show  you  another  man  who  did.  Hear  what this  man  said: \n\n “I  have  fought  a  good  fight,  I have  finished  my  course,  I  have  kept  the  faith” (2  Tim  4:7).  These  are  words  of  the  renowned Saul  of Tarsus.",
