Minister Dew Keys, CEO of Sound From Heaven puts it in his own words...\n\n\"...today was just a test to see if it was possible...your presence here is our confirmation...next year, we will fill the stadium to capacity...\"\n\n   Always behind the scene, these guys made the evening an aesthetic one; MBS SYSTEMS, 44 PICTURES, and MR. BLISS (sound designer). \n\n   The peak moment was the keynote delivered by the impeccable Dew Keys where he not only led a powerful worship session followed by a word of wisdom, but also enlightened everyone present on how the Holy Spirit works...\n\n\"...we are the pen casing, the Holy Ghost is the INK...we are made the express image of God...in all you do, LOVE; because LOVE is the only thing the devil can't fake...\"\n\n   Overall, the Live Recording Concert 2020 first (or test) edition was an elative experience and we can't wait for next year's.\n\n![Sound from Heaven](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyt6izhug/image/upload/v1606559119/sfh02_z0p5wr.jpg \"Moments in the event\")\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
