Added to music, he is an acclaimed teacher of Computer Science (ICT), Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry. He is also a computer graphic designer.\n\n\nWhile in Secondary school, he was drawn to secular artists, contrary to his Christian norms and doctrines;\n\n\n> **”… When I heard rappers like Lil Wayne, Drake, and M1 rap, I would develop chills…”** \n\nhe says.\n\n\n Unfortunately, the thug and drug life these rappers promoted in their music hindered him from expressing his love for the art.\n\n\nIt was a burning passion in his heart. Christ T wrote lyrics on every surface possible. Despite being a science student, he unconsciously respected the laws of the rhyme scheme in writing.\n\n\n\tIs this talent or what?!\n\n>\n> **“I would literally freestyle on beats in the church as a kid…while praise and worship are going on. No one can hear me…except maybe God”**\n>  \t\n>\n\nChrist T’s passion finally had a release when he encountered Apostle Lefor Divine in 2013 and became the first artist to sign under his record label, Wisdom Records.\n\n\nChrist T recorded his first track, titled **“Free Boy”**. \n\nFrom there, his journey professionally kicked off with his recording and releasing his first mixtape, **“The Sages”** Vol 1.\n\n\n Volume 2 followed after that. Just like the first, it was also a mixed tape of both his music and those of other artists under the same record label.\n\n\nIntent on moving forward, Christ T began performing in street events and other platforms, where he met other rappers like Bate Mone, Lp Lekingson, and G4.\n\n\nIt has been a forward and upward movement since then. Christ T recently married his sweetheart (2019).\n\n\nThe multi-talented rapper is also a lead Pastor of a church in Limbe, a branch under God’s Business Agency aka Wisdom Center Int’l. \n\n\nDespite the lows in his path, Christ T remains optimistic. He is currently working on a new album titled **“The Supernatural EP”.**\n\n It will be released come November 2020.\n\t\n\nIn addition to that, he is also on a national tour. He will be visiting churches in the SW, NW, Littoral, and Central regions of Cameroon.\n\t\n\nFor more updates on Christ T, follow on;\n\n IG:egbeterenceebaino\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nTwitter: Christ T the Rap P2\n\t\t\t\t\t             \n\n YouTube: Wisdom Records 237\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nFacebook: Christ T the Rap prophet\n\t\t\n\nWell, it’s a good thing Christian rap is gaining global acceptance.
