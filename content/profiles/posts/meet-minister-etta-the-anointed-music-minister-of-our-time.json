Minister Etta is anointed to win souls through music, lead people and teach them how to get connected with God via worship.\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c-9dusU8-_Y/WrRvl_fMlPI/AAAAAAAAAzs/RfKFMwbStjQxRi0emQoqhkZ1ZVHxAgDyQCLcBGAs/s320/IMG-20180322-WA0025.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c-9dusU8-_Y/WrRvl_fMlPI/AAAAAAAAAzs/RfKFMwbStjQxRi0emQoqhkZ1ZVHxAgDyQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG-20180322-WA0025.jpg)\n\n\\\n\\\nIn that light, Minister Etta has been manifesting his gift for more than 10 years now. Going through all the sacrifices , being obedient to God and his mentors and proving him self worthy.\n\n>  It is one thing to find our your purpose and a different thing to manifest it\n\n\\\nHe is a very successful singer. Has held concerts all over the nation, received awards , hosted shows.\\\n\\\n\" I organise a worship concert every year called ( we worship) . It's a concert which brings together talents in the gospel sector into an overflowing atmosphere of worship . \"\n\n| [![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mT9N2yTzwmE/WrRvt1uG_SI/AAAAAAAAAzw/2xcQDOdlezI67K06gcAOsT1mMMsU_CZFgCEwYBhgL/s320/IMG-20180322-WA0023.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mT9N2yTzwmE/WrRvt1uG_SI/AAAAAAAAAzw/2xcQDOdlezI67K06gcAOsT1mMMsU_CZFgCEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG-20180322-WA0023.jpg) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Worship concert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n\\\n\\\nHe is also a song writer, and an instrumentalist .\\\n\\\nStill, he is not satisfied and won't rest until he changes mindsets , grooms other artists and also elevate the Cameroon Gospel platform .\\\n\\\n\" There are a lot of untapped talents in Cameroon , even in our churches . The gospel platform is full of talents but no one ever knows them .\\\n\\\nThey barely have a place to showcase their talent or be exposed to the world . It is my vision to change that.\\\n\\\nOur predecessors did not build the platform for us . All they were interested in was ; sell their album and make money. They barely cared what was going to happen to the future upcoming artists.\\\n\\\nBut that has to change too. We cameroonians should have our own voice , our own stand in music and create our own platform.\\\n\\\nA platform where we can be able to express ourselves in our own unique ways without being westernized or trying to copy the Nigerian style .\\\n\\\nCameroonians do not know how to consume their own products or support their own. If you go to churches, if a worship song is not done in a foreign language, then it won't be appetizing to the Christians . This mentality has to stop.\\\n\\\nWe have to get to a level where , we enjoy our own worship songs , in our own language and embrace our own products .\\\n\\\nWorship ministers should learn to use their own songs or their colleagues song for worship or ministration. This is how we will grow. \"\\\n\\\nNonetheless, it is not been an easy journey but with God being the driver of his life, everything has fallen into place .\\\n\\\nAs we all know,\n\n> Nothing ever grows without rain\n\n\\\nMinister Etta has had dark moments in his life but all that was to prune him into becoming the best version of himself. God doesn't just place you in the promise land , he pulls you from Egypt through the wilderness , then the promise land . It all takes a process .\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F6Y_nPzHY94/WrRwHWk9d_I/AAAAAAAAAz8/wHa_R72HXVwHDBWrEcj8QE8VIdVRQKQAwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG-20180322-WA0021.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F6Y_nPzHY94/WrRwHWk9d_I/AAAAAAAAAz8/wHa_R72HXVwHDBWrEcj8QE8VIdVRQKQAwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG-20180322-WA0021.jpg)\n\n\\\nSo with his high level of experience, he advices other gospel artists both upcoming and established that ;\\\n\\\n\" I'll say as an artists, believe in your self . Don't wait for anybody to push you or elevate you, elevate your self .\\\n\\\nBe your own motivator . Create your own platform , hold your own concerts , bring our your own events . No one will create a platform for you .\\\n\\\nIf you have the hitch in you that you want to make music for God . Then start . People will join you or add fuel but no one will push you . Be your own hero.\\\n\\\nIt is okay to have a Mentor but you have to first of all believe you can do it .\\\n\\\nAlso be creative . The platform needs creativity. Not just copy cats but people who are creative enough to bring something new to the table . To bring out new trends and be unique in their art. \"\\\n\\\nNotwithstanding, every talent was given for a purpose. And that purpose is to build the kingdom of God . What ever field or brand you choose, make sure you are manifesting it all to the glory of God .\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
