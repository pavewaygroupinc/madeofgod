It means nothing, when you love playing football yet you have never dared to enter the field to play.\n\nIn that light, below is a story of a girl who found her passion and turned it into a business venture. Her creativity and her craft have become her identity. To have passion is a great thing, but it will be best when served to the world and let others benefit from it.\n\nAbout Lilian Belle Menda\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y9l8H-djGl4/W7wivU723ZI/AAAAAAAALNs/TVzKxg9N65AhB19LilaUSJ4mlnSph2XlgCLcBGAs/s320/IMG-20180829-WA0010.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y9l8H-djGl4/W7wivU723ZI/AAAAAAAALNs/TVzKxg9N65AhB19LilaUSJ4mlnSph2XlgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG-20180829-WA0010.jpg)\n\n\\\nI am Lilian Belle Menda, the creative director and C.E.O of my delightful and unique brand called ENTICE. We beautify our wonderful clients by offering services in make-up and sales of original makeup products,nail arts,fashion clothing and accessories.\n\n## Her Story\n\nI think talking about my inspiration in business simply means when I realized my skills could earn me commercial value because I have always had that uniqueness in style and taste since from when I was a child.\n\nFrom cutting my clothes my parents bought with scissors just to give me my own looks which most times got me in trouble to applying makeup I will buy in a very enticing way that called for attention.\n\n\\\nBack in the university days,when I realized that my friends always got to me to draw their eyebrows and/or do their makeup, I now decided to ask one who approached me an amount of money which she did give me, I was amazed that she could just give me the money like that.\n\n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FSx47wgDXMc/W7quMWrxDVI/AAAAAAAALFw/gUoGIBwQQ9c2BxYZsuULFWV2DOQM6tNyQCLcBGAs/s320/PicsArt_09-29-08.16.00.jpeg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FSx47wgDXMc/W7quMWrxDVI/AAAAAAAALFw/gUoGIBwQQ9c2BxYZsuULFWV2DOQM6tNyQCLcBGAs/s1600/PicsArt_09-29-08.16.00.jpeg)\n\nI then decided to place a monetary value on my services which did not end there. I thought to myself that if I should monetize this skill, then I need to increase my knowledge in it.\n\nThat made me do more research on the whole art which I realized it is a whole business on its own. My undiluted quest for more knowledge on this skill has brought me this far.\n\nI started my fashion business too alongside the makeup services I offer due to the attention I always had when I wear my own unique designs. I started by making for a few people and due to recommendations, I got to increase my scale of production.\n\nOf course as a business person,there are obstacles I faced and will face because challenges come to promote us,teach us and open our eyes to see more opportunities.\n\nOne major challenge I faced was at a time when I invested so much money wrongly. I did no feasibility studies on that. I just went ahead and invested and that affected my business so badly but I thank God for Grace.\n\nThere are times in business you will question if you were actually to do that business (hahahaha).\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_cxaabnRnKE/W7quUq6KOqI/AAAAAAAALF4/JFRmQM37u6YIyPVxpWHpA-RFsX-UJg5lwCLcBGAs/s320/PicsArt_09-29-07.52.02.jpeg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_cxaabnRnKE/W7quUq6KOqI/AAAAAAAALF4/JFRmQM37u6YIyPVxpWHpA-RFsX-UJg5lwCLcBGAs/s1600/PicsArt_09-29-07.52.02.jpeg)\n\n\\\nI won't really say I wanted to give up. No I did not because my business is driven by passion. So at each time I feel things are not going the way they should, I always look back to find out where the problem may be and I correct it. This principle has worked for me and will continue to work. So I will not give up for any reason.\n\nWhen a client gets to me and say,\"Please make me look beautiful\", the first thing I will do is appreciate the person and make her know how genuine I think she looks because we all are unique in our different looks.\n\n\\\nMy impact in my business is making all those that come in contact with my brand love their uniqueness and God-given looks first.\n\nWhatever addition to what the come with is just an expression of how the feel at the moment not a cancellation of who they are.\n\nMy goal is to make those I come in contact with see their self values, accept and be contented with what they have and see whether it is the makeup or clothing just an expression of how they are feeling at that moment in time.\n\nI love this business because I'm addicted to seeing people look their best and confident.\n\n## Her Goals\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TuimhsmgfBw/W7qurrRwK0I/AAAAAAAALGI/khpR8FS6RIUMA2oIz3eydJonaZ2fMoFTQCLcBGAs/s320/PicsArt_09-29-07.48.40.jpeg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TuimhsmgfBw/W7qurrRwK0I/AAAAAAAALGI/khpR8FS6RIUMA2oIz3eydJonaZ2fMoFTQCLcBGAs/s1600/PicsArt_09-29-07.48.40.jpeg)\n\nI see **ENTICE** brand as the refuge and answer for all our beauty quest and also the solution center for all those who want to regain their confidence and self value.\n\nIn 5 years,we must have been topping the beauty industry in Cameroon,Africa and the world at large in quality products and services and the reference point for excellence in the fashion world. We are establishing our brand and doing basic international collaboration that will gain us more knowledge and opportunities.\n\n**Her Advice to the World**\n\nKnowledge is what will make you standout in whatever you do. As a business mogul you've got to thrive for knowledge and ensure you apply it appropriately.\n\n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-skVixOJ9DwQ/W7quiWQ8pTI/AAAAAAAALGA/eMyCwFWhwrkZZmx-ULrliZGnN-pYOu6ZQCLcBGAs/s320/PicsArt_09-29-08.17.49.jpeg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-skVixOJ9DwQ/W7quiWQ8pTI/AAAAAAAALGA/eMyCwFWhwrkZZmx-ULrliZGnN-pYOu6ZQCLcBGAs/s1600/PicsArt_09-29-08.17.49.jpeg)\n\nSecondly,let your passion be your driving force in this business and always associate with those who have made it already in the field. Get yourself a mentor(s) and be humble.\n\nGod bless you.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
