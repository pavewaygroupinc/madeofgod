I have been into music since I was a boy with the Baptist Church.\n\nI used to write songs and I had the talents for that but I had no message, but since I got the revelation of the Gospel of Christ presented to me by Pastor Jonathan , the way I did music changed and I began doing music with purpose and impact.\n\nGospel music is to me the closest way we can explain to humanity what Jesus Christ has done for . I BELIEVE THAT by the presentation of the Gospel we can heal men from disease, sing immortality into their thoughts and life.\n\n### His Passion\n\nI have been amusic lover by heart since birth but only actually started doing music when I joint assemblies of God church where I was part of the choir and later on became the lead bassist. I later on formed a gospel music group called lyte Band which was made up of Victor Lereh (Sas) and Raymond Echikiye (Ray Prime) currently working with me at the Lyte Studios.\n\nLyte studios was given birth to bring the gospel into every home and mind. By the Gospel we mean the Undiluted message of the cross because itâ€™s the only thing that set men free from their suffering that is why we have as our slogan listen and live. I have produced for artist like Ankini, Menko Prosper, Min Etta, Spice of glory, Audrey Nguen etc\n\nWell as a role model My Man of God Apostle Jonathan who happens to be a great composer and Singer, Buchi inspires me so much.\n\n**Advice to Gospel Artists**\n\nGospel music in Cameroon is promising but I will say Gospel music is not a kind of beats but the content of the message. I will advice gospel artist to know their bibles and what is the message for our time. This will help them compose songs that are relevant to the church as a whole.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
