What a blessing !!!\n\n> \"I have been singing since I was 14 but started a professional journey 9years ago with the Flames choir where I have been and am being groomed therefore I’ve been a worship leader for 9years\".\n>\n> Using your gift to bless God's people is the best thing anyone could ever ask for. Using your purpose to serve Him, is success because most people never even get the chance to fulfil theirs. Miss Maureen has been an active participant in the body of Christ, and for that she deserves a badge of honor.\n>\n> > \"My inspiration is the God I sing for and the people I minister to. I mean gospel music is an amazing way to reach out to people and bring them closer to God. My aspirations is to go as far as it can take me.\"\n>\n> \\\n> And we pray that , as she keeps on steadily in this journey or path of hers, may her desires be granted .
