(Phone ringing...)Silence...\
Thierry is calling, but I won't answer. I don't even want to talk to him, especially not now! You probably think I'm heartless; before you judge, let me take you to when it all started...\
\
3 years ago, on the 10th of June, my very first boyfriend, Mike, had a birthday. Poor boy, he couldn't even afford 3 square meals; so I surprised him with a brand new and furnished bungalow, painted with his favorite color. I took him up with his eyes closed. He was so anxious, when I opened his eyes, he ran for the switch. Unfortunately, he tripped over an exposed cable, got shocked and died on the spot. The experience was so painful, I decided to never date again.\
\
6 months later, I met Sly. He reminded me so much of Mike because of his dimples. Gawd, I was falling in love again. Sly, however, had wealthy parents, and he wore earrings. 3 months later, his birthday arrived and I really wanted to avoid the incident with Mike. So I bought him a brand new hummer limo and inscribed his name on the number plate. The day finally arrived, with heavy rain. Sly couldn't wait to see the "gift"; he insisted and we drove there. Upon arrival, lightning struck his earring and killed him-in my "gift". Paparazzi was everywhere but thanks to dad's societal status, I got off.\
\
I mourned Sly for 9 months. The first day I decided to go out after the experience with Sly, I met Pharell. We became fast friends, which soon developed to love. However, he was asthmatic and thus allergic to shock and surprises. Few months later, he told me of his upcoming birthday. What could I possibly give to the first and only child of a wealthy parents?...I decided to give Pharell my most "precious jewel". So, when we got to his room on his birthday, I undressed and said, "For all my love, I give you all of me". Pride and happiness registered on his face. Walking towards me, he suddenly gripped his chest and struggled to say "My love, I will always--lo-ve---yo--" and he died of shock; in my naked arms.\
\
I had lost 3 guys in 3 straight years on the 10th of 3 different months!!!\
\
Now you know why I can't pick Thierry's call; That's because today is his birthday, and I know he hates being kept waiting; but I don't have a choice. I hope you'll join me 5 days later, when I explain things to Thierry... that's if he doesn't DIE of anger...\

The people’s dream.\
The nation’s nightmare.\
*The children’s fairy tale.\
The elder's folklore.*

The land they say will be our home.\
But before we get there, we will all be numb;\
*drained from the bullets they shoot.*

*All we hear are stories\
that don’t correspond with our miseries.*\
When will the day come for us to finally see our land?\
When all we get is bodies buried underneath the ground.

We thought our promise land will give us milkshakes and honey,\
But no, it welcomes us with blood baths.\
*What is the future that we hope for,\
If we can’t even make it past the present?*

Time is expanding,\
memories are fading,\
moments are passing by.\
*But it still feels like the clock has stopped ticking.*

Lives have been paused, some have been lost,\
meanwhile, some have no clue where they are headed.

*When the guns play their bullet music,\
we dance hastily with our feet on the ground.\
How did we master the steps so fast?*

Gunshots have become the sounds that blast louder in our homes,\
than Mr Leo’s songs we would normally play on our speakers.

*We adapted too fast, and slowly we rest six feet\
beneath the ground in the hands of men in black.*\
Apparently, everywhere has gone dark;\
no one can see through the smirked smiles we have on our faces.

It is sad.\
*If only we can get peace,*\
then our tumult will cease;\
but right now, that’s only a wish.

All we can do is hope and pray\
*If only the Ambazonian dream is possible,\
we should make it there in one piece.*

“The secret of great style is to feel good in what you wear”.

It does not matter what you wear but how you wear it.  The best way to achieve that top confidence after you dress, is to own your style. 

I always tell my clients that , You alone should be the judge of your style, not anyone else; but it’s very important you know comfort counts a lot when you’re all dressed up. 

Once you start portraying some signs of discomfort, that’s when you give another person the upper hand to be the judge of your style. Some instances where you let someone else judge your sense of style includes:

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\[endif]-->Trying to pull down a short dress which is already short enough and can’t increase an inch.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\[endif]-->Dangling on high heels.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->·<!--\[endif]-->Trying to cover up some parts of your body when you already dressed e.g. boobs. Just to name a few.

You should also take note of the fact that another person’s style won’t be as comfortable or good on you as it is for that person. Like I always tell my clients you should know your dos and don’ts as long as styling is concerned.

We all have different body colors, shapes and sizes. What fits so well for A won’t even look admirable on B.

You should know your go to style, yes people might say you’ve got a particular style but pay no attention, that’s what fits you and you’re comfortable in, you shouldn’t try to change that for anyone else but for you and mind you if you’re to change that, your mirror should be your number companion and jury.

Try different styles in front of your mirror and see if most importantly you are comfortable in it, there’s no harm in taking some fashion risks you know. Each and every one of us is unique in our own styles.

So the next time you step out your door all dressed up, walk like you are on your runway. Chin up and let the universe copy your style.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The song back up is an Afro trap inspiration that expresses God as the only hope that can never fail despite the failures in the world economies, political systems,national and international bodies and governments, shortages and limitations due to human frailty. 

When you are in a strange land and everything fails you and you know no one what do you do?  Put all your trust in the Lord and not in your bank account,skills,technical know how, beauty,or handsomeness. 

 Psalm 5 \[11]But let all those who take refuge and put their trust in You rejoice; let them ever sing and shout for joy, because You make a covering over them and defend them; let those also who love Your name be joyful in You and be in high spirits. 

Its from this understanding that prompted the inspiration behind "Backup" . Back then in boarding schools,only those who had back up food in their trunks survived "famine periods".

 As we listen and promote the song no matter what is happening in the world, you are becoming Goshen that increased despite Economic recession.

"Hi. My name is "Tata-Mu", 

which is my dad's mother-tongue for "My Father". I am twenty-nine years old and quarantined in my four-bedroom house; but aren't we all quarantined? (chuckles) Working from home, it's pretty much the same routine everyday; wake up early, work, eat, sleep, do more work, and eat again. 

At the end of the day, I relax in front of my TV screen, with my cozy couch being my sole companion. When national lock down was decreed, I thought of ways to pass my leisure time- away from just “watching movies”.

 My girls advised that I start a blog...I gave it some thought and BOOM. Here it is: ta-daaa! But first, a little background story about myself... I was born first to A family of seven-well, two families, actually. This is to say, I'm the first to my dad and two moms...confusing, right? 

Let's go back to when it all started...

\    \* \* \* \* \* \*

 Twenty-nine years ago, my dad met my mom in a hospital. He was a strapping young doctor who had just gotten his first posting to the town of Ekondo-Titi. Intelligent, handsome, smart and rich were enough qualities to lure my mother into his arms.

 I was the(scratch that)-I am the product of that union. However, the fleeting romance ended when daddy was re-posted and he had to move away-with me, of course! It was quite a fight in court but mom didn't have the necessary connections...

I was five years old when dad and I moved from Ekondo-Titi to Bamenda. Long story short, dad got married and had six kids after me. You're probably waiting to read how boring and imperfect my life is, but on the contrary, it isn't: I'm single, I have a wonderful job, I'm rich (enough), I-have-total control over my life; my life is perfect! 

What more can a girl ask for? After all, you only live once, right? With that, Tata-mu ended her first blog post and hit \[Enter]...Seriously though, 

"you only live once?" "what more could a girl ask for?" It seems life has something in store for our girl's ignorance... 

To be continued...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[TATA-MU (Episode 2) 

Gentle drum beats hovered around Tata-Mu's mind. It started from a distance, then continued to draw in. Closer and closer, it got. Followed by hushed voices, she transcended to consciousness. 

Croocked fingers poked her cheeks to check for any signs of life. Blinking severally, she opened her eyes. A squeal escaped her lips at a finger poised over her face. Retracing his hand, the stranger stepped away from her. 

"She's alive", he confirmed. Confusion mused Tata-Mu's brain as strange faces and numerous pairs of eyes stared down at her. 

Panic stricken, she jittered to a sitting position; the semi-circle of people standing over her made way for her to freely sit up. Where is she? Who are these people? Last she checked, she was sitting in her couch blogging- wait!! 

She threw frantic glances around, as if searching for something. Where is her laptop? Her phone? This must be some kind of a dream! Fret transformed her demeanor as a thousand thoughts crossed her mind. 

These people looked like idol worshipers. Perhaps they were going to sacrifice her to their gods.


	Noticing the mixed emotion on her face, a man stepped forward. Judging by the ancient crown on his head, she figured him to be their leader. Judging by his looks, she would give him mid or late thirties.

 Judging from her  five-foot- three, he was of average height in her eyes. He was all bronze and hard. 

Despite the hardness of his face, his eyes were black but warm; welcoming even, with a little streak of hope. Heat crept up her face when she couldn't stop her eyes from trailing down his length. 

A piece of leather covered his groin (thank God! she thought), and reached down to his thigh. Unlike the men and kids who had on only same piece of clothing, she noticed the women had their breast covered too. 


Goodness! Why on earth, would people still dress like this in this century? 
As if reading her thoughts, the leader spoke up, "we are of the Ekangetti village". He has a funny accent, Tata-Mu thought. "Do not be afraid. I am Angett, the leader", he continued.


As if she didn't hear the first time she asked again to be sure, "where am I?"
"Like I said earlier, you are in Ekangetti village"


"Where is this place found? Is it even on google map?" Her questions were met with silence
"Can someone help me with a phone?  No one?", and she continued to fret. 
The Ekangettis stared at her both with doubt and perplexity. 

Their comments couldn't go unnoticed, "Is she the one? Are you certain she'll pull through? Could it be the gods made an error this time? She doesn't even know our language? Hm, she's sure going  to die on the first round...

" and so on. By now, she had stopped her fidgeting. "What? selected by the gods, what gods? Oh no, I'm going to die...please don't kill me! I-I have m-money, I could pay. I have possessions, I'll give you whatever you want", she ranted on and on.


After observing her a few minutes, an amused unreadable expression crossed Angett's face. Holding a hand up, he shushed everyone. "The gods can never be mistaken; listen, she's reacting to what we were saying. This can only mean one thing-she understands our language".

 They turned their attention to a ranting Tata-Mu, "-anything, but please don't sacrifice me to your gods. Please I'm begging you, Angett-"


Everyone gasped at her use of their leader's name so casually; Like a movie, they turned their attention to Angett as he took intimidating steps towards Tata-Mu. 

Her face grew pale and she shut her eyes and waited for a hit, when Angett raised his left hand. Breaths held, the Ekangettis anticipated the strike on Tata-Mu. 

Instead Angett burst into a throaty laughter, shocking everyone.
"You're not going to die...at least not yet..."
"What?", confused
"Welcome to Ekangetti". He extended his hand towards her, "what is your name?"
She hesitated, "T-Tata-Mu",
"T-Tata-Mu"? he prodded to confirm
"No, Tata-Mu" 
"Tata-Mu...Tata-Mu", he repeated. 

"Beautiful name: "Tata-Mu". This time it sounded husky coming from him. What is wrong with you? Seriously "husky", where's that even coming from? Focus! Tata-Mu, focus! 

These people are idle worshipers who will not give a second thought to sacrifice you and appease their so-called "gods". Tata-Mu sobbed internally. 

Why had she not made an effort to go to church when her  cousin invited her? Perhaps God would've stepped in to save her.

 Who knows what her fate held now-
"-does it mean?"Angett asked. Tata-Mu realized she had wandered off with her thoughts
"Huh?"
"Your name. What does it mean?"


"It is (clears throat) an endearment to God... S-since God is a father, we call Him "My Father", hence "Tata-Mu". By now the fear she felt before was already oozing out through her responses.


Angett paused to reason it out..."My God"
"It's My Father", this earned an iron stare from Angett, "or My G-God. A-anyone's fine by me", Tata-Mu stammered.


If anything, she was nothing like a saint; talk more of being "God"-Ha! Rather it reminded her of her faithlessness. Why they chose to call her "God" she did not understand. 

As if on cue, she made a silent prayer: God, if you get me out of this-this- situation, I promise I will never miss out on any opportunity to project your word. I promise God, just please, get me out of this.


Oblivious to her prayer, Angett continued; "Come, My God"


"Tata-Mu, please"


After a short pause, Angett complied. "Fine, Tata-Mu. Come with me"
"W-where are we going?"
"To the palace, of course"; he looked at her like it was the natural thing for her to know "The palace" 

it came out more like a statement


Angett signalled for everyone to return to their various homes for the night; leading Tata-Mu North, he walked off towards the palace with four male guards, two on each side.


"Yes. You see, the gods have sent you to answer our prayers. Our land is dying Tata-mu and we need a foreign eye to help us solve this ill-luck"
"Hahaha. Save?

 Look I'm sorry, but you got the wrong girl"


"Not us, the gods; and they are never wrong...Like it or not, you are one of us now Tata-Mu and it is your duty to your people". 


Sooner than she expected, they arrived the room where she would spend the night. Yes, that's what it was-ONE NIGHT, and then she was gone...but she had to rethink-gone where? 

She was too mentally exhausted to pay attention to the decorations in the room, besides it was night time. Who in her shoes would notice something like that?


Self-doubt, uncertainty, and fear etched Tata-Mu's face. First of all, taking up this "duty" would mean she will remain here- and she can't. This could not be happening to her. 

She needed to rest; hopefully by the time she gets up, it would all be one big dream.

 As if reading her thoughts, Angett put her to sleep.


"Sleep now. I know this can be too much to take in...by morning, you will be well rested; then we can go over the details". 

Angett's voice suddenly became a soothing lullaby in her ears.


"I pray the gods give you reason to believe"


Too tired to answer Tata-Mu responded with barely a nod. With one thought in her mind that this would all be a dream come morning, she surrendered to the welcoming arms of oblivion.]]></content:encoded>

‘I do not know what else to do so that people can see me for the person that I really am’ She said sadly.

Pauletta had a gotten pregnant when she was eighteen years old from a boy whose where about is not known. 

Two years after she had her baby, she thinks people don’t see her (Pauletta) for who she is. 

To her, all people see is a girl who got pregnant at 18, not a girl with skills and dreams and a life ahead of herself. She feels ‘Invisible’

Like Pauletta, many girls and maybe some boys find themselves in this ‘box of invisibility’

 We battle with society’s definition of who we are and what we ought to be, the expectations of what girls/boys our age and maybe size have to be and become. 

Most often, this is conflicting with the reality of who we are and who want to be. 

Sometimes, people constantly tell us we don’t fit into a certain space and we are not enough. 

The idea that we are not enough and so there is no room for us in certain places, the pressure to conform and fit in an environment sometimes smothers our dreams, our understanding of who we truly are, our ambitions and self confidence that we feel insecure and unworthy.

But if there is one thing, I have come to realize is that people’s definition of who they think we are should not be the last word because that is not our story.

 More than ever before, I have come to believe in the power of telling our stories as individuals and how important it is for us to rewrite our stories as we live them because no one can tell our story better than us.

 As they say ‘If we don’t tell our stories who will?’ 

The way I see it, we have two options; We can let society and its institutions tell our stories and define us in a way that is dis-empowering and a misrepresentation of who we are **OR** we can rewrite our stories, own it and live in the truth of our reality in a way that empowers us.

Whatever our choice will be, let us know that our stories and our voice is our power, let no one take that away from us.

 We need to use our stories to create room for ourselves, rooms that are safe for us and recognize our flaws and our strengths, rooms that celebrate us.

YOU ARE ENOUGH, YOU ARE VISIBLE!!!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Gospel artist Bukonge Terence, starts a journey to introduce people into the tasteful, deep, unconditional and endless love of God. And that is not all, he also strives to teach people the unsearchable things of Christ in his musical package titled " The Glorified series". 

Bukonge Terence in his onw words, describes the pproject: 

"The Glorified series is a project made up of a number of songs the Holy Ghost has given me for the past years. Most of the songs were written in my time of fellowship and Church services. Initially, the plan was to release the songs all in an album but I changed it because I wanted every song to be uniquely done and sent out at specific dates during the year so that people can take out time to digest the messages contained in each song.

I believe that the Gospel has not yet been preached because when and if it is preached people will begin to not fear death because death is not a must for all

The songs are contained in the project have been written and composed for one purpose, to bring men to the truth about the cross and worship the father in spirit and in truth

Some of the songs like Abba Pere what I just released will be in French so as to Bring in the French speaking peopleto have a taste of the Project. But the project is for the whole world, whether you are Muslim, Christian, and Atheist etc. The project is for everyone because God is in everyone out there but they don't know it.

The project will feature some Prominent Cameroonians Gospel artist too but will only be announce when the one comes."

NB: You can find the first song titled: Abba Pere, in the Music Library .

Though she prefers to be called Maguy Abiba, Abiba Aruna Maguy is a "muslim-turned-christian" missionary.\
\
Born in Kalima (DR Congo), the 38-year old has committed to worshipping and praising God, contrary to her background. This is to say her background can't put her back on the ground.

>  When asked why the swap, she said,"...because worship and praising God is my lifestyle...the Holy Spirit is my inspiration"

\
Maguy Abiba has two songs to her name: "Yes" and "Mama Africa".\
\
Despite her zeal, the artist cannot ignore financial constraints. But she's still pressing on.\
\
When Maguy is not planning on going global with her art, she takes care of her darling husband and their child.

It is one thing to say the concert was a blast but in reality, it was a huge lesson.\
\
Not that the Cameroonian artists aren't good enough but in every successful story, we must pick out important lessons to better our lives and careers.\
\
Therefore, if you observed the concert, you should have picked up these important lessons from the Nigerian artist.\
\
1. She's fun and energetic on stage: ministered for 2 hours plus in both buea and douala and no time was recorded when the audience slowed down. There was a great connection between the artist and her audience. From start to finish everyone was on their feet, dancing and singing along with her.\
\
2. She's strict : if Ada said she wanted something, then that is what she's getting. Was quite a handful for the organisers but it's the thing that made the event a success. In other words, the lady knows what she wants and aims at it. Nothing or anyone can stop her.\
\
3. She's organised: from her backup singers, to her songs and her stage performance , everything was in order . She plans well ahead of time which is one of the things that leads to her delivering a memorable performance.\
\
4. She's relatable : others could call that humble but the fact that she ministered to her fans under the rain, is something to clap for. Some people hoped the concert was going to stop when the rains started , but the rain was the best thing that happened to the concert. She still gave her fans a prolific performance and it was all so vibacious.\
\
5. She's professional and at the same time spiritual : prays as though she doesn't work and work as though she doesn't pray.\
\
Nonetheless, thumps up to the Cameroonian artists who performed along side , and to the organisers of the event. It was the first of its kind and we pray it isnt going to be the last.\
\
Lots of organisational errors made, so many people had complains to give, but we can't downplay the fact that, this very concert will go down memory lane.\
\
With the lessons learnt, we believe a lot will change in the Cameroonian gospel music sector . Eyes have been opened, attentions have been drawn and work has begun.

Worship Exodus appreciates every gospel minister who partook in the event, especially Pastor Okala of Full Gospel Buea Town.

The good news is, come next season, the event might be hosting an international guest artist. So, don't miss it

In that light, new knowledge begets heavy tasks, for to whom more is given, more is required. Hence , participants are expected to reign in their various domains after attending such a conference.\
\
And as Emma gospel (the host) puts it, the conference was aimed at elevating worshipers into their predestined heights of glory.[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CvLxkvFzZ8o/XiVmfmoBAeI/AAAAAAAA8NE/iC5sR1s6aZU4MVazuUos3IPaN6bQrm3ZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG-20200115-WA0049.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CvLxkvFzZ8o/XiVmfmoBAeI/AAAAAAAA8NE/iC5sR1s6aZU4MVazuUos3IPaN6bQrm3ZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG-20200115-WA0049.jpg)

As Cameroonian gospel artists, Christian acts , worshipers (dancers, writers, bloggers, spoken word artists, comedians , entertainers, athletes, workers, business guru's etc) have come a long way , but we are yet to meet our aspiring results .

\
So the conference brought together teachers and every other person to help identify our problem and teach on a plethora of solutions.\
\
Topics taught include; branding as a gospel minister , maintaining focus in minister , purpose / vision, honor, spirituality , relationship , running a musical band, voice training , ministration guides etc.\
\
In tidbits,\
\
Rev Etta gave the

**difference between gospel and Christian music .***\
Gospel music : any song with ethical lyrics*

Christian music : Christ centered music , it's written about him and sung to him, it must carry Jesus name and the beliefs of Jesus .*\
Rev Gabiga taught on**Purpose**and he said :[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oTkY6nGZwYE/XiVnaqOLSAI/AAAAAAAA8N0/nzzZJyxuCT88z2yU9iy5273oP1d1xvVOACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG-20200116-WA0012.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oTkY6nGZwYE/XiVnaqOLSAI/AAAAAAAA8N0/nzzZJyxuCT88z2yU9iy5273oP1d1xvVOACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG-20200116-WA0012.jpg)

*Purpose is not what you were born to be; rather it is what you do with what\
you become that is purpose fulfillment.**\
Pilate was born to save a king but he\
cowardly backed off.**\
Great heights are not attained and maintained by being passionate about the\
vision but being passionate about the purpose.**\
When vision become stronger than purpose, ambition is born*\

**The anatomy of a song (Song Structure)**

*Knowledge of the various parts of a song and their functions greatly helps in writing your own song.*\
*\
There are several parts to a song, although every song must not contain ALL these elements.*\
*\
The Verse\
The Chorus\
The Bridge\
The Hook\
Most songs sung today will have one of several structures\
The Chorus-Only format\
The Verse Only Format\
The Verse and Chorus format\
The Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus format\
The Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge*\
Etc...\

The teachings were mind blowing and it enthralled the audience, as everyone apparently went home satisfied and impacted.

\
And oh, there was an explosive all night concert. Tagged : Spirit to Spirit\
\
The songs were very original and creative. The ministers exposed their very original shade, as most of them sang their own songs and that of their pals.

\
A sign to show, we are getting to where we are aiming at. That is, a concert where our artists didn't bring their Nigerian cousins (songs) to the event.\
\
It was pure , original and sophisticated. The worship was on another level. We experienced a shift in the atmosphere , the Holy ghost was present. The whole place was set ablaze with the glory of God.\
\
Further more, as per the organisation , MadeofGod tv was on that desk so there can hardly be any criticism (lol sigh , I don't care lol) .\
\
Nonetheless everything was superbly done, but it's okay to drop a suggestion or a critic in the comment section.\
\
Certificates were awarded for registered participants along side a designed mug .\

Before we dive deep into the topic, ask yourself the following questions :\
\
If you are an established worship leader, have you faced challenges in branding yourself?\
\
Does the word branding sound easy to you, but when you start, you don’t get the expected results?\
\
Have you ever branded yourself?\
\
Are you a brand?\
\
Are you a human being ?\
\
Are you a spirit?\
\
Do you have an identity?\
\
Do you have name?\
\
The first thing you need to know is; The first element of your brand is your identity.\
\
The definition of your identity is your existence. And by virtue of the fact that you exist, it means you have an identity and because you have an identity, you have a brand.\
\
Now, if branding is made easily achievable, will you be happy?\
\
**How to build a brand**\
\
As a true worship leader, there is one thing you need to change;\
\
The dynamic of your music from emotional entertainment, to a soul winning and soul keeping tool because you are a minister of God.\
\
Eartly music connects with you at the level of your emotion.\
\
A minister simply means you are using music as a tool to preach the gospel. So when yiu sing anything, it has to be the word of God. Which means that Jesus is the base of your.\
\
Anything you are singing as a worship leader, must be based on the finished work of Christ on the cross. As a worship leader, you should know the difference between Godly and earthly sorrow.\
\
Worship that is not of God provokes earthly sorrow, meaning people will cry under your ministration but you will not see any transformation in their lives.\
\
During this type if ministration, you will think God is using you but it is the devil using you instead.\
\
At this time, you are meeting the people at the time of their earthly needs, very far from their spiritual needs. Hence when you are singing, they are crying but as soon as you are done, they continue with their same lifestyle .\
\
So, as a teacher of the word of God, you must watch out In other not to lead people astray. Your gospel must spread the truth and the undiluted gospel of Jesus Christ. Even if no one is buying your song, stay glued to the true side.\
\
3 steps to look at as far as your music and brand is concerned\
\
1. You cannot brand Jesus, your assignment is to use music to create awareness in the world about who Jesus is.\
\
2. You are different from secular artist, those people do not need to work because satan is all in their business. As a gospel artist, what you are sending outside is spirit, many obstacles will come against it. Hence, your brand is not in the physical sense of the word but spiritual.\
\
Make no mistake, branding books will tell you that; in order to create a successful brand , do these things: define the mission of your music, define yoiur ideal audience, the style etc. but this is not really what should define your brand as a gospel artist.\
\
Most secular artist, define their brand around a physical appearance (clothes, hair cuts, fashion trends etc) . You minister unto souls, people age, not souls, in other words, there is no need focusing on style in order to brand.\
\
When a secular person sets up a brand, it has an age demographic. So during a particular year for instance, they can target between the ages of 5- 15 . after these ones pass, your style changes to fit the next generation and so on.\
\
But as a gospel minister, you are ministering to souls that transcend generations. Every note you send out, God keeps that music until the end of time. Hence, gospel music has no expiry date.\
\
3. branding has things to do with your brand, genre, and perception but that is not all there is to it. Being a worship leader is not traditional, it is the biggest ministry that God can entrust in the hand of a human being. The judgement of music ministers will be terrible.\
\
Your music is the expression of your personality. There is no product that can impact human beings like gospel music. Music has a spiritual impact on those that listen to it, that is why no one can go a day without music.\
\
Furthermore, we all want to rise, but ask yourself; in the midst of other artists, why or how should I rise? Why you?\
\
Learn what you must do in order to get to where you want to be. Like preachers, evangelist, worship leaders must be original.\
\
Nothing under the earth is new, everything that is happening has been done before. There is no music that you can sing today that has not been done before. But there will always remain one thing which is unique and that is you.\
\
You are specially made. Your music is a direct reflection of that uniqueness in you.\
\
Who is the audience of a worship leader?\
\
The world.\
\
There is no limit to the audience of the worship leader. Who ever told you that “ your target audience” delete it, because your audience is every living soul. Before being a worship leader, you are called by God as a minister of God.\
\
In the normal ife, they will tell you in order to brand, have a visual representation, do a logo etc but there is, more.\
\
Music is very abstract, it is something you cannot quantify.\
\
There is a unique sound that identifies as your identity and your job as a worship leader, is to find that sound. That’s why a worship leader will have 100 songs, but 1 song will come one day , that the world will know you for.\
\
Music is complicated, even you musicians cannot fully understand. Music is a language, spirit, music is in everything.\
\
Even when you walk, snore, eat , you generate music. What God has given you is too big for you to play with it.\
\
branding gospel music from a physical perspective is very challenging because it brings so much power. And your task is to harness this unbelievable power, that is expressed through the medium of sound and to synchronize it and represent it in a visual content for the consumption of your audience.\
\
Gospel music is so empowering, powerfull and dominating in the minds of those that are listening but it comes out as a sound.\
\
As a minister , you have the challenge to harness the power of that sound, for power without purpose is useless. You want someone to listen to your song and have visibility of the kingdom in their mind. What you see you believe very easily .\
\
Many people will tell you to match your brand to the sound of your music, but your brand is jesus. So in every genre, Jesus can be found. In other words, you can still use bikutsi, rap, pop etc to represent Jesus.\
\
Your goal is be authentic to create a brand that matches your music and the gospel of Jesus Christ.\
\
Be honest to yourself\
\
Have you ever found yourself in the point of lack of focus fear, doubt, emptiness, resentment, indecision , frustration etc. if any of these things have happened to you, it means you have not yet found your purpose.\
\
If you are not yet aware of your purpose, it becomes a cause of struggles in your life. Purpose drives a man. A worship leader that has purpose, lives from inside to out but he that has no purpose lives from outside to in.\
\
If you have no purpose guiding you, you will dance to the tune of social, emotional, and mentorship pressure but to the tune of Jesus, you will be in rebellion.\
\
And If your purpose is for the salvation of souls, then you will think on how you write those lyrics. To achieve your purpose, strife to be totally original and avoid copying.\
\
You are no longer concerned on how other people sing or dance when you have found purpose and your originality. When that song is of Jesus, souls will be won and that will be for the glory of God. Jesus is your brand. Start with Him and end with Him.\
\
A music minister must spend his time in the place of worship. The symbol of your brand is the time you spend with God.\
\
The pictures you design , in those physical things you are already the best. If you were manifesting physical things you would have been known. But in the light of spirituality , God is saying come into a place of worship and a new song will be downloaded into your spirit.\
